= Geronimo Microprofile

This repository is intended to provide some aggregators for Microprofile at Apache Geronimo.

It can be:

1. Some pom regrouping different specifications
2. Some pom regrouping different specifications+geronimo implementations
3. Some pom enriching a server with the implementations
4. Etc

But it must not be a project with real code, it is just about aggregation and potentially documentation.
