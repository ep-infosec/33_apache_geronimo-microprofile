Note we also provide some pom aggregator to import all the stack at once:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.geronimo</groupId>
  <artifactId>geronimo-microprofile-aggregator</artifactId>
  <version>${geronimo-microprofile.version}</version>
  <type>pom</type>
</dependency>
----

If you want to investigate your Microprofile setup you can also play with our reporter link:reporter.html[UI/webapp].

We also provide Î¼~ (utilda) which is a pom with link:http://openwebbeans.apache.org/meecrowave/[Apache Meecrowave] and the Aggregator pom which makes
you a one dependency Microprofile 2.0 server, ready to use:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.geronimo</groupId>
  <artifactId>utilda</artifactId>
  <version>${geronimo-microprofile.version}</version>
  <type>pom</type>
</dependency>

WARNING: the 1.0.0 release binary has some versioning issues, ensure to evaluate the snapshot until we release next version please.

Finally we provide a set of Microprofile extensions to make it faster to be production and cloud ready
like a secure Microprofile config converter to credentials and a Docker integration. Read more on the dedicated link:extensions.html[page].
